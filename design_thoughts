In the current scheme, within each computation, there will be a cache and a docker box for that computation. Cache will be in both local and remote side.

how coinstac save the variables in the cache? 

The input of every docker will be something like

{
  input:{}
  cache:{}
  state:{}
}


The output of every docker will be something like

{
  cache:{}
  state:{}
  output:{}
}

coinstac will save the output field of each run into the input field of next run.
so when dump the result variables out, we need to specify the field to hold the variables. 

And for the original dataset, we need to read in from the initial input and save them into the local cache

coinstac retrieve the final output from the remote node's output
